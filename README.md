# museumStore
In previous chapters, you worked with a museum store. In this project, create a class for the items that are sold in the store. There are 3 types or categories of items – clothing, toys, and tools (like pencils). The class for the inventory items needs instance variables for the name, category, price, and quantity in inventory. Create a constructor that accepts those 4 pieces of data to populate the instance variables for the inventory item object. Write a method to display the inventory items. Create a “sell” method that accepts a parameter for the quantity sold. First display the information – the item and requested quantity. If there is enough quantity in inventory, the sale is good, so remove that sold quantity from the inventory quantity and display a message with the cost of the sale. If there is not enough quantity in inventory, display an error message that there was no sale.  In the driver class, instantiate 6 items in inventory, 2 of each category. You may choose the details of those items. Display the 6 items. Write the code to sell some quantity of 3 of the items – one of those sales attempts must be invalid, trying to sell more than the available quantity. After each sale attempt, display the inventory item to show the change in quantity. Even if the sale was not valid, display the inventory item.  Note that there is no user interaction in this project, you are testing the methods by calling them explicitly.
